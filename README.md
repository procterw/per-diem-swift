# Per-Diem

Per-diem is a feature-light daily tracker for logging activities, journaling, and tracking progress. This app's UX and technical design is driven by three principals:
 - The top priority is making it as convenient as possible to log a variety of daily activities.
 - For most people, the best way to track growth is consistency. Therefore, day-to-day consistency and looking through old entries is more important than metrics or data that require more complex data entry.
 - Nobody needs another app that collects data, especially for something so simple.

This app will be released in January 2023.
