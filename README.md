# Per-Diem

Per-diem is a feature-light daily tracker for logging activities, journaling, and tracking progress. This app's UX and technical design is driven by three principals:
 - The top priority is making it as frictionless as possible to log a wide variety of daily activities. Logging the occurance of an activity is more important than details.
 - For most people, the best way to track growth is consistency. Therefore, day-to-day consistency and looking through old entries is more important than metrics or data that require more complex data entry.
 - Creating more accounts and trusting additional parties with your data is not great, which is why this app is iOS only and makes use of the Core Data APIs and iCloud.
